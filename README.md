# MPC_Design_Project
This Repository contains the MATLAB Code and corresponding helper functions for the control of an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot as part of the course SC42125-Model Predictive Control

main.m contains the majority of the code and performs the following tasks:
1. Defines the continuous and discrete model of the Omnidirectional Mobile Robot.
2. Calculates the Terminal Set corresponding the to given constraints and plots it.
3. Performs Point-to-Point Control under Full Information State Feedback.
4. Performs Point-to-Point Control under Output Feedback in the presence of disturbances acting on the input channel.
5. Trajectory Tracking under Full Information State Feedback
